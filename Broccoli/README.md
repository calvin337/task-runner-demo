To run Broccoli example:
1. NPM install dependencies 
2. Run 'Broccoli build output' in command line. Output refers to the name of the folder that will output the result of the build. 

Note: You need to delete the output file before running Broccoli. I did not include the additional code to delete pre-existing build folders to simply the example.
